Known issues and limitations with this release

   do not take effect until after the involved endpoints receive one more
   message with the original link timeout values.

2) ALLJOYN-830: SetLinkTimeout cannot be called from within the
   SessionPortListener::SessionJoined callback.


Compatibility
-------------
Applications written for AllJoyn 1.X will need to be modified and rebuilt
for use with AllJoyn 2.0 and later.

The AllJoyn wire protocol related to encryption and authentication has changed
in the 2.1.0 release. AllJoyn interfaces that use security will not inter-operate
with devices whose AllJoyn version is less than 2.1.0.

The AllJoyn wire protocol was modified to have a 128kB maximum message size
starting with version 2.1.0. Earlier versions of AllJoyn which attempt to
send messages that are greater than 128kB will not inter-operate with versions
greater than or equal to 2.1.0.

Starting with version 2.2.0, AllJoyn clients on Android must obtain the
manifest permissions needed to access wifi and Bluetooth in order to reach
external AllJoyn nodes. These permissions are INTERNET,
CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE, BLUETOOTH and BLUETOOTH_ADMIN.

Starting with version 2.2.0 BusAttachment::Stop(bool) and
BusAttachment::WaitStop() were changed to BusAttachment::Stop() and
BusAttachment::Join() to be more consistent with the internal threading model
of AllJoyn (ALLJOYN-803).
